# bash-swagger-codegen library

## Overview
This is a Bash client generator for REST services from their Swagger specification.

This generator uses [swagger-codegen](github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen).

## What's Swagger?
The goal of Swaggerâ„¢ is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, Swagger removes the guesswork in calling the service.


Check out [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) for additional information about the Swagger project, including additional libraries with support for other languages and more. 

## Usage

### Generating Bash client for REST service

Get the sources:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/bkryza/bash-swagger-codegen
```

Build the generator jar:
```shell
$ mvn assembly:assembly -DdescriptorId=jar-with-dependencies
```

Generate the client:
```shell
$ java -cp target/bash-swagger-codegen-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar io.swagger.codegen.SwaggerCodegen generate -l bash -i http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json -o output

$ chmod +x output/client.sh
```


### Using the Bash script

```shell

# Print the list of operations available on the service
$ ./client.sh --help

# Print the service description
$ ./client.sh --about

# Print detailed information about specific operation
$ ./client.sh addPet --help

# Call REST API operation
$ ./client.sh --host http://petstore.swagger.io addPet 



## TODO
[] Add checking if all required parameters are provided
[] Add option to specify default cURL options in codegen which will be passed to each command
